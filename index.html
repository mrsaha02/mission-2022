                A web developer is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the
                development of World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. A web developer may specialize
                in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or
                both (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web
                applications.

            <p>
                The term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an
                international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used
                to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.
